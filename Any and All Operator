-- The SQL ANY compares a value of the first table with all values of the second table and retuns the row if there is a match with any value.
SELECT column

-- Suppose we want to find teachers whose age is similar to any of the student,s age.
SELECT * 
FROM Teachers 
WHERE age =  ANY (
    SELECT age
    FROM Student
);

-- We can use the =, < and > with the ANY and ALL keywords 
SELECT *

WHERE age < ANY (
    SELECT age

);
-- The query will select rows if age in the outer query is less than any age in a subquery.

-- The SQL ALL operator
-- The SQL ALL operator compares a value of the first table with all the values of the second table and returns the row if there is a match with all values.
SELECT column
FROM table1
WHERE column OPERATOR ALL (
    SELECT column 
    FROM table2
);

SELECT *
FROM Teachers
WHERE age > ALL (
      SELECT age
      FROM Students
	);
-- The query above returns teachers with ages which match all the student ages.

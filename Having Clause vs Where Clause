-- The SQL having clause is used if we need to filter the result based on aggregate functions 
-- That is max(), min(), avg() and count().


SELECT AggFunc (column), extra-columns
FROM table
GROUP BY target_column
HAVING condition

-- The HAVING clause was introdued because the where clause does not support aggregate functions.
-- The HAVING clause is executed after the GROUP BY clause while the WHERE clause is executed before the GROUP BY clause.

-- For Example 
-- We want to write a query to filter out rows with employees having a salary of more than 100,000
SELECT * FROM employee

SELECT * 
FROM employee
where salary > 100000

-- But with the HAVING clause, we can use an aggregate function like AVG salary.
SELECT *y
FROM employee
GROUP BY emp_id 
HAVING AVG(salary) > 100000

Challenge
You have a table called Employees with the following columns 
employee_id, first_name, last_name and department
Your task is to write a query to find the duplicate of the first_names

SELECT first_name, COUNT(*) AS name_count
FROM Employees
GROUP BY first_name
HAVING count(*) > 1

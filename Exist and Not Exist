-- The Sql Exists operator tests the existence of any value in a subquery i.e it executes the outer SQL query only if the subquery is not NULL

SELECT column1, column2, 
FROM table
WHERE EXISTS(SUBQUERY);

-- For example 
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM Customers
WHERE EXISTS (
   SELECT order_id 
   FROM Orders
   WHERE Orders.customer_id = Customers.customer_id AND amount < 120000
   );
   
-- Checks for the order_id of customers in the Orders table where amount is less than 120000
-- Returns the customer_id and first_name of customers from the Customers table who have made a purchase of less than 120000

-- We can also use the NOT operator to inverse the working of the EXISTS clause.
-- For example 
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM Customers
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
   SELECT order_id 
   FROM Orders
   WHERE Orders.customer_id = Customers.customer_id AND amount < 120000
   );
-- Here, the SQL command returns a row from the Customers table if the related row is not in the Orders table.

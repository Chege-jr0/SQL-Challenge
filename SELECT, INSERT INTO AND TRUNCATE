-- The SQL Command to show the databases in SQLlite
SHOW DATABASES

-- SELECT INTO command creates a new table in the current database.
-- The Syntax of the SQL SELECT INTO statement is

FROM source_table;

-- You can go further and copy data from one table to another in another database.
-- We can do that by using the IN clause 
-- The Syntax is

in destination_database.mdb
FROM source_table. 

-- You can copy records from one table to another existing table.
-- Syntax 
INSERT INTO destination_table ( column1, column2)
SELECT column1, column2, column3
FROM source_table;

-- Copy data from Two Tables to One
-- We can also copy records from two different tables using the JOIN clause with INSERT INTO SELECT

INSERT INTO CustomersOrders
SELECT Customers.customer_id, Customers.first_name, Orders.amount
FROM Customers
JOIN Orders
ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer_id;

-- SQL, DELETE AND TRUNCATE
-- In SQL, the DELETE clause is used to delete row from a database table
-- Syntax
DELETE FROM table_name
[WHERE condition];

-- In SQL, the TRUNCATE TABLE clause is another way to delete all rows from a table at once.
-- The DELETE supports the WHERE clause while the TRUNCATE doesn,t.
-- The DELETE can remove single mutiple, or all rows from  a table, while a TRUNCATE can only remove all the records from a table.

-- Syntax
TRUNCATE TABLE Customers;

-- we use the like operator with the where clause to get the resukt that matches the given string problem
-- keep in mind the % and _ wildcards when using the like operator.

select *
from customers
where country like 'UK'

-- the sql not like operator
select *
from customers
where country not like 'usa'
-- here the sql command selects all the rows that do no have usa in the country column
-- They can get as complicated as possible with the and or operators



-- WILDCARDS
-- The _ is a wildcard character that represents one character after a string
select *
from customers
where country like 'US_'

-- The query will return the results that have USA or USD JUST one character after that.


-- The % is a wildcard character when used can be used to filter the name which is followed
select *
from customers
where country like 'U%';

-- The query will return the countries  starting with the character U

-- The [] is used to represent any one character inside brackets
select * 
from customers
where country like 'U[KA]%';

-- The query will return the rows that have country starts with U and is followed by either K or A

-- The ! wildcard in SQL is used to exclude characters from  a string
select * 
from customers 
where last_name like '[!DR]%';

-- The query selects rows whose last_name does not start with D or R

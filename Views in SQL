-- In SQL, Views contain rows and columns similar to a table, however views dont hold the actual data.
-- You can think of a view as a virtual table environment that,s created from one or more tables that,s easier to work with data.

select * from customer_data

-- creating a view 
CREATE VIEW us_customers AS
select first_name, last_name
from customer_data;

-- selecting everything from the view
select * from us_customers

-- Updating a view 
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW us_customers AS
SELECT *
FROM customer_data
WHERE last_name LIKE 'Doe'

-- Deleting a View
DROP VIEW us_customers;

-- We can join tables on a view and work on the data from there.
